                        <h3>Our Contract</h3>
                        <p>
                            All reservations are made with Happy Peru Tours (RUC:20608801686) By booking a trip with us,
                            you are deemed to have accepted these Booking Conditions (which constitute the entire
                            agreement between you and us) and your reservation will be accepted on this basis. The
                            services to be provided are the services indicated on your invoice with the reservation
                            confirmation.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Acceptance of reservations and payments.</h3>
                        <p>You can book online and we accept your reservation. Once the reservation is made, our
                            Department of Reservations sends you an email along with a reservation confirmation invoice.
                            (also check your spam folder). A contract between us will be concluded from the
                            invoice date of confirmation, or if you book a tour within 2 days before your departure, the
                            contract will enter into effective as soon as we accept your 100% payment.

                            Payment details can be found on the booking confirmation invoice. If your
                            deposit (or the payment of 100% in the case of a reservation 2 days before the departure of
                            the tour) is not paid before of the date of expiration, we reserve the right to consider
                            your reservation as cancelled!
                        </p>

                        <h5>Deposit requirement</h5>
                        <p>
                            For your reservation to be confirmed, a deposit of 20% or 50% per person and per trip is
                            required. The balance due can be paid in cash upon arrival in the city of Cusco. If your
                            reservation is made within 2 days before the departure date, 100% of the total amount must
                            be paid at the time of reservation. Please note that bank transfer fees are already included
                            in the price of the first payment!
                        </p>

                        <h3>Prices and Surcharges</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since we publish our prices well in advance, we may occasionally face significant cost
                            increases due to factors beyond our control. For this reason, we reserve the right to impose
                            surcharges (or reduce prices) up to one month prior to departure due to increased admission,
                            fees or other transportation costs, taxes if required by government action, or otherwise.
                            Any surcharge or price reduction will be fully explained and justified by Happy Peru Tours
                            before its implementation. If any surcharge supposes an increase of more than 10% of the
                            cost of the program, the client may cancel the reservation, which must be made at least one
                            month before the date of departure, and will receive a reduced refund only for the expenses
                            already incurred.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Risk taking</h5>
                        <p>
                            Some Happy Peru Tours itineraries have been designed to provide participants with exposure
                            to the true nature of the environment visited. They therefore involve an element of personal
                            risk and exposure to potential risk that could result in physical or emotional injury,
                            paralysis, death or damage to the client, their property or third parties. The client
                            understands that such risks cannot be simply ruled out without compromising the basic
                            qualities of the activity and therefore assumes them as part of the tour. The client
                            declares that he is aware of his health and physical condition and that he has consciously
                            decided to assume the aforementioned risks. The client excludes Happy Peru Tours from any
                            liability associated with any accident or injury that may occur in relation to the health,
                            physical condition or otherwise of the client.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Authority on Tour</h5>
                        <p>
                            The decision of the Guide or another representative of Happy Peru Tours will always be final
                            in all matters that may endanger the safety and well-being of the tour group. The client
                            must always strictly comply with the laws, customs, foreign exchange and drug regulations of
                            Peru. If the client does not comply with the above, or if it disturbs the well-being of the
                            group, the Guide or another representative of the company may order the client to leave the
                            tour without refund.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Travel documents</h5>
                        <p>
                            Client must be in possession of a valid passport and all required visas for the entirety of
                            the trip and Client accepts responsibility for obtaining them. Any information or advice on
                            visas, vaccinations, weather, clothing, luggage, special equipment, etc. are provided by
                            Happy Peru Tours in good faith but without responsibility on the part of the company.
                            Factors Outside the Company's Control (Force Majeure) The company will endeavor to minimize
                            the impact of matters beyond its control, but cannot accept any responsibility for such
                            matters, which include political disputes, border closures, visa denials, protests, delayed
                            flights, unpredictable weather, landslides, etc. The client agrees to accept all additional
                            costs derived from these factors.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Responsibility</h5>
                        <p>The company is not responsible for any damage or loss if the breach of contract was:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Attributable to the client.</li>
                            <li> 2. Attributable to a third party unrelated to the provision of the contracted services,
                                and the fact is unforeseeable or unavoidable.</li>
                            <li> 3. Due to unforeseen and unusual circumstances beyond the control of the company,
                                whose consequences could not have been avoided even if due care had been taken
                                precautions.</li>
                            <li> 4. For political disputes, strikes, weather or other matters of a similar nature and
                                any other force majeure.</li>
                            <li> 5. For an event that the company could not foresee or prevent with all diligence.
                                Any liability is limited to the total price paid for the tour. In any
                                case, the company expressly excludes all liability for loss or indirect expense
                                or consequential, including lost profits.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Claims and Complaints</h3>

                        <p>
                            If the client has a complaint about the company, they must first inform the Tour
                            Guide/representative of the company during the trip so that the guide/representative can try
                            to correct the situation. Any other complaints must be submitted to the company in writing
                            within 7 days of the completion of the tour. I declare that I have had ample opportunity to
                            read this document in its entirety, that I have read and understood it, and agree to be
                            bound by its terms.

                        <p>
                            The most important fact about the Inca Trail is that it must be booked well in advance! You

                            send you an email along with a reservation confirmation invoice. (Please also check your
